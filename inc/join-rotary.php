        <p class="join-rotary__desc">We originally established as the Rotary Club of Belfast in 1969 before
                                    merging with Kaiapoi Rotary in 2011 to become the current Rotary Club of
                                    Belfast-Kaiapoi. <br>
                                    The Club is well known for its “friendly vibe” with many members forging
                                    lasting friendships. Social Activities are encouraged and well patronised throughout the year.
